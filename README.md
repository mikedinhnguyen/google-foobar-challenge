## My Google Foobar Challenge attempt

On July 27, 2020, I was working on LeetCode questions, and had to refresh my memory on Java ArrayList syntax when I saw something peculiar below my search bar...

I was pretty excited as I had heard about this "secret" challenge just about a few weeks ago. Hurriedly, I clicked the "I want to play" button and the page opened up to a terminal like screen.

This GitHub repo showcases and documents my journey through the Google Foobar challenge. I stopped on August 14, 2020 when I unfortunately ran out of time for my 6th problem.  

Each folder was a problem from Google Foobar in the order of when I received the question. Some will have a code file, which contains the source code for that question, and a markdown file, detailing my approach and my thoughts and feelings during the challenge.

## Final Thoughts and Conclusion  

I think it's definitely an opportunity you do not want to miss if prompted, even if you don't think you can handle it. I learned a very good amount of mathematics and different ways of coding in my language (Java). Don't go in thinking you're going to complete the challenge or else you won't really have that fun of a time with it, believe me.  

I've heard rumors of people getting another chance at the Foobar challenge at a later time, and if that's the case, I'll be waiting to infiltrate Commander Lambda's space station again...
